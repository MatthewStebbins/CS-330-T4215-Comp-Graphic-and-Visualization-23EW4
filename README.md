How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

	I approach software design incrementally. If I can start with opening a blank window and build functionality step by step, I can more easily troubleshoot my work to fix the errors that pop up. This class reinforced this style of programming as each week we built upon what we worked on the previous weeks. 

How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

	Along with designing incrementally I learned that shapes can be reused. Shapes can be scaled, rotated, and translated using the same vertices without needing multiple arrays with the same vertices. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

	This class helped me to apply more of the math I’ve learned about matrices and vertices and the application of linear algebra. This lead me to a deeper understanding of these concepts.
